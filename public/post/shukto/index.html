<hr>
<p>The history of Shukto is deeply rooted in the cultural and culinary traditions of Bengal, a region in South Asia that is now divided between the Indian state of West Bengal and the independent country of Bangladesh. Shukto has a long and rich history, and its origins can be traced back to ancient Bengali cuisine.</p>

Shukto, with its unique blend of bitter vegetables and spices, is a prime example of this culinary philosophy. The use of mustard oil and the inclusion of bitter gourd and bitter drumsticks give the dish its characteristic taste, which may be an acquired one for those not familiar with Bengali cuisine.</p>
