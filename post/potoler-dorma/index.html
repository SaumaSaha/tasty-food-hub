<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>8-10 pointed gourds (potol/parwal)</li>
<li>1 cup grated coconut</li>
<li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
<li>2-3 green chilies, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ginger paste</li>
<li>1 teaspoon garlic paste</li>
<li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
<li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon garam masala powder</li>
<li>Salt to taste</li>
<li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil for frying</li>
<li>Fresh coriander leaves for garnish</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>For Stuffing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In a mixing bowl, combine grated coconut, chopped onion, green chilies, ginger paste, garlic paste, coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala powder, and salt. Mix well to form a homogeneous mixture.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>For Preparing Potoler Dorma:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Wash the pointed gourds thoroughly. Trim both ends and make a vertical slit on one side, keeping them intact at the other end. Remove the seeds carefully to create a hollow cavity inside the gourds. Rinse them again to remove any remaining seeds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stuff the prepared coconut mixture into each of the hollow gourds using a spoon or your fingers. Press gently to ensure the stuffing fills the gourds evenly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully add the stuffed pointed gourds one by one into the pan. Fry them until they turn golden brown and crispy on all sides. You may need to turn them occasionally to ensure even cooking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once cooked, transfer the fried Potoler Dorma onto a plate lined with paper towels to absorb any excess oil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Garnish with freshly chopped coriander leaves before serving.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Serving Suggestions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Serve hot Potoler Dorma as a side dish with steamed rice or Indian bread such as roti or paratha.</li>
<li>You can also serve it with a side of plain yogurt or any chutney of your choice for added flavor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you prefer a healthier alternative to frying, you can bake the stuffed gourds in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for about 25-30 minutes or until they are cooked through and lightly browned. You can also air-fry them for a crispy texture with less oil. Adjust the cooking time as needed based on your oven or air fryer.</li>
</ul>
