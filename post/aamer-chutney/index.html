<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>2 large raw green mangoes, peeled and chopped</li>
<li>1 cup sugar (adjust according to taste and tartness of mangoes)</li>
<li>2-3 tablespoons mustard oil</li>
<li>1 teaspoon panch phoron (a mix of fenugreek seeds, nigella seeds, cumin seeds, black mustard seeds, and fennel seeds)</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>
<li>Salt to taste</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<hr>
<p>. <strong>Prepare the Mangoes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Peel the raw mangoes using a peeler or knife.</li>
<li>Cut them into small, uniform pieces. Discard the seeds.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p><strong>Heat Mustard Oil:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In a heavy-bottomed pan or kadhai, heat the mustard oil over medium heat.</li>
<li>Mustard oil has a strong flavor, so ensure it&rsquo;s heated well but not smoking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Add Panch Phoron:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Once the oil is hot, add the panch phoron mix.</li>
<li>Allow the seeds to crackle and release their aroma, which will take about 30 seconds to a minute.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Add Mangoes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Carefully add the chopped mangoes to the pan.</li>
<li>Stir well to coat the mango pieces with the oil and spices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cook the Mangoes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cook the mangoes over medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
<li>This helps the mangoes to soften slightly and absorb the flavors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Add Sugar:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After the mangoes have softened a bit, add the sugar to the pan.</li>
<li>Stir well to combine the sugar with the mangoes.</li>
<li>Adjust the amount of sugar according to your taste preference and the tartness of the mangoes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seasoning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sprinkle red chili powder over the mangoes for a hint of heat.</li>
<li>Add salt to taste.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simmer:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lower the heat to medium-low and let the chutney simmer.</li>
<li>Stir occasionally to prevent sticking and ensure even cooking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Thicken:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Allow the chutney to simmer until the mangoes are completely softened and the mixture has thickened.</li>
<li>This may take around 15-20 minutes depending on the consistency you prefer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cool and Store:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Once the chutney reaches your desired consistency, remove it from the heat.</li>
<li>Let it cool to room temperature before transferring it to clean, sterilized jars.</li>
<li>Store the aamer chutney in the refrigerator for longer shelf life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Serving Suggestions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Enjoy Bengali-style aamer chutney as a condiment with rice, roti, paratha, or any Indian bread.</li>
<li>It also complements snacks like samosas, pakoras, or even as a spread in sandwiches.</li>
<li>Use it as a side dish for your meals to add a burst of tangy flavor.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these detailed steps, you can create a delicious batch of Bengali-style aamer chutney to elevate your meals. Adjust the sweetness and spiciness according to your taste preferences for a perfect balance of flavors.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<hr>
<p>The history of Aamer Chutney, or Bengali-style mango chutney, is deeply intertwined with the culinary traditions of Bengal, a region located in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent, which is now divided between Bangladesh and the Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura, and Assam.</p>
<p>Mangoes have been cultivated in this region for centuries, and their use in cooking can be traced back to ancient times. Mangoes hold a special place in Bengali culture and cuisine, and they are celebrated during the summer months when they are in season. Raw green mangoes, with their tart flavor, are particularly prized for their culinary versatility.</p>
<p>The tradition of making chutneys, which are savory condiments made from a combination of fruits, vegetables, spices, and sugar or vinegar, is also deeply rooted in Indian culinary history. Chutneys have been a part of Indian cuisine for centuries, with each region having its own unique variations and recipes.</p>
<p>The exact origins of Aamer Chutney are not well-documented, but it is believed to have originated in Bengal, where mangoes are abundant during the summer months. Aamer Chutney likely evolved as a way to preserve the flavors of raw mangoes and enjoy them throughout the year. The combination of tart mangoes with spices and sugar creates a delicious and versatile condiment that can be enjoyed with a variety of dishes.</p>
<p>Over the years, Aamer Chutney has become an integral part of Bengali cuisine, often served as a side dish or condiment with rice, bread, or snacks. It is also enjoyed during festive occasions and celebrations, adding a burst of flavor to the meal.</p>
<p>While the exact history of Aamer Chutney may be difficult to trace, its popularity and significance in Bengali cuisine speak to its deep-rooted cultural heritage and the love for mangoes in the region.</p>
