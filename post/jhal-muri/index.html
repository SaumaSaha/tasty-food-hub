<hr>
<p>Jhal Muri is a popular and flavorful street food snack from Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal. It is a light and crunchy mixture made primarily with puffed rice (known as &ldquo;muri&rdquo; or &ldquo;moodi&rdquo; in Bengali), along with various other ingredients that contribute to its unique taste and texture. Jhal Muri is known for its spicy, tangy, and refreshing flavors.</p>
<p>Jhal Muri is not only a tasty snack but also a cultural symbol, enjoyed by people during various festivities, gatherings, or as a quick and satisfying street food treat.</p>
<p>Jhalmuri-wallahs have dotted streets and lanes of Kolkata since time immemorial, precisely since World War II, when this tangy, hot and sweet nutritious street food was introduced by immigrants from neighbouring Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. These days, each Kolkata neighbourhood proudly boasts of their ‘Jhaalmuri guy.’ It is intriguing that such a simple mix of ingredients can demand such finesse - a little of extra something, or a little less of something, and the whole concoction is thrown off gear.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>4 cups puffed rice (muri)</li>
<li>1/2 cup peanuts</li>
<li>2 tablespoons mustard oil</li>
<li>2-3 green chilies, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 medium-sized onion, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 medium-sized tomato, chopped</li>
<li>1/4 cup freshly grated coconut</li>
<li>2 tablespoons tamarind pulp (adjust to taste) or use raw mango for tanginess</li>
<li>1 teaspoon chaat masala</li>
<li>Salt to taste</li>
<li>Fresh coriander leaves, chopped (for garnish)</li>
<li>Optional: Sev (crispy chickpea noodles), boiled potatoes, cucumber, or any other preferred additions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Prepare Ingredients:</strong></p>

</ul>
</li>
