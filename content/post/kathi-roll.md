## History

---

The history of the Kathi roll is closely intertwined with the culinary heritage of Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), India. The origin of the Kathi roll can be traced back to the late 19th century, and it has since evolved into a beloved street food across India and beyond. The Kathi roll's history is a fascinating tale of cultural exchange, adaptation, and innovation.

The Kathi roll is believed to have originated in the streets of Kolkata during the British colonial era. Its creation is often attributed to Nizam's, a well-known eatery in Kolkata, which was established around the 1930s. Legend has it that the Kathi roll was invented to cater to the needs of British officers who wanted a portable, non-messy meal that they could enjoy on-the-go. The name "Kathi" is said to have been derived from the Bengali word "kathi," which means "stick" or "skewer," as the original Kathi rolls were skewered with sticks for easy handling.

The traditional Kathi roll consisted of skewered pieces of kebab wrapped in a paratha or roti, providing a convenient and flavorful meal for busy individuals. Initially, the filling primarily consisted of grilled meat, such as chicken or mutton, along with onions, spices, and sauces.

Over time, the Kathi roll underwent various adaptations and innovations to suit different tastes and preferences. Vendors and eateries in Kolkata began experimenting with different fillings, including vegetarian options like paneer (Indian cottage cheese) and egg. The addition of chutneys, sauces, and fresh vegetables further enhanced the flavor profile of the Kathi roll.

The popularity of the Kathi roll transcended the streets of Kolkata and spread to other parts of India, where it became a staple street food item. In recent years, Kathi rolls have also gained recognition internationally, with Indian restaurants around the world offering their own interpretations of this iconic dish.

Today, the Kathi roll remains a symbol of Kolkata's vibrant street food culture and culinary innovation. It continues to delight food enthusiasts with its delicious combination of flavors, making it a timeless favorite for locals and tourists alike. From its humble beginnings as a portable meal for British officers to its status as a global street food phenomenon, the Kathi roll's journey reflects the rich history and diversity of Indian cuisine.
