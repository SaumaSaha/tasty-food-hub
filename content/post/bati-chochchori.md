## Ingredients

1. 2 medium potatoes, peeled and diced
2. 1 medium eggplant, diced
3. 1 cup pumpkin or squash, diced
4. 1 cup green beans, cut into small pieces
5. 1 cup cauliflower florets
6. 2 medium tomatoes, chopped
7. 1 onion, finely chopped
8. 2-3 green chilies, slit lengthwise
9. 2 tablespoons mustard oil or any cooking oil of your choice
10. 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
11. 1 teaspoon mustard seeds
12. 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
13. Salt to taste
14. A pinch of sugar (optional)
15. Fresh coriander leaves for garnish (optional)

## Instructions

1. Prepare all the vegetables by washing them thoroughly and chopping them into bite-sized pieces.

2. Heat mustard oil or cooking oil in a large pan or kadhai over medium heat.

3. Once the oil is hot, add cumin seeds and mustard seeds. Let them crackle for a few seconds.

4. Add the finely chopped onion to the pan and saut√© until it turns translucent.

5. Add the diced potatoes to the pan and stir well to coat them with the oil and spices. Cook for 3-4 minutes.

6. Next, add the diced eggplant, pumpkin, green beans, and cauliflower to the pan. Mix everything together gently.

7. Sprinkle turmeric powder over the vegetables and season with salt according to your taste preferences. Add a pinch of sugar if desired.

8. Stir the vegetables well to evenly distribute the spices. Cover the pan and let the vegetables cook over medium-low heat for about 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.

9. Once the vegetables are slightly tender, add the chopped tomatoes and slit green chilies to the pan. Mix well and cook for an additional 5-6 minutes until the tomatoes soften and release their juices.

10. Check for seasoning and adjust salt if necessary. If the vegetables seem dry, you can sprinkle a little water to create steam.

11. Once all the vegetables are cooked through but still retain their shape and texture, remove the pan from the heat.

12. Garnish Bati Chochchori with fresh coriander leaves, if using.

13. Serve hot as a side dish with steamed rice or roti.
