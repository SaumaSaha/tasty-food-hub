## Introduction

---

Chom Chom, also known as Cham Cham or Chum Chum, is a popular sweet dish originating from the Indian subcontinent, particularly Bengal. It is a traditional dessert made primarily from fresh homemade cheese, called paneer or chhana, which is kneaded into a dough, shaped into small cylindrical or oval balls, and then cooked in sugar syrup.

Chom Chom has a rich, sweet taste with a slightly chewy texture from the paneer, and it's often served chilled, making it a refreshing treat, especially during hot weather. It's commonly enjoyed during festivals, celebrations, and special occasions in India and Bangladesh.

## Ingredients

---

1. 1 liter full-fat milk
2. 2 tablespoons lemon juice or vinegar
3. 1 cup sugar
4. 4 cups water
5. 1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder
6. A few strands of saffron (optional)
7. Desiccated coconut or grated mawa for coating (optional)
8. Chopped pistachios or almonds for garnish (optional)

## Instructions

---

1. **Prepare the Paneer (Chhana):**

   - Pour the milk into a heavy-bottomed pan and bring it to a boil over medium heat.
   - Once it starts boiling, reduce the heat and add the lemon juice or vinegar gradually while stirring gently.
   - Continue stirring until the milk curdles, and the whey separates from the curds.
   - Remove from heat and let it rest for a few minutes.
   - Line a sieve or colander with cheesecloth and strain the curdled milk. Rinse it under cold water to remove any traces of lemon juice or vinegar.
   - Gather the edges of the cheesecloth and squeeze out excess water. Hang the cheesecloth for about 30 minutes to drain any remaining liquid.

2. **Knead the Paneer:**

   - Transfer the drained paneer to a clean surface and knead it well until it becomes smooth and soft. This process helps in making the Chom Chom soft and smooth.
   - Divide the paneer dough into equal-sized portions and shape them into cylindrical or oval balls. Make sure they are smooth and free of cracks.

3. **Cook the Chom Chom:**

   - In a wide pan, combine the sugar and water and bring it to a boil, stirring until the sugar dissolves completely.
   - Gently drop the paneer balls into the boiling sugar syrup.
   - Cover the pan and let it simmer over low heat for about 15-20 minutes, or until the paneer balls are cooked through and become spongy.
   - Remove the pan from heat and let the Chom Chom cool down in the syrup.

4. **Flavoring and Coating (Optional):**

   - Once cooled, add cardamom powder and saffron strands to the syrup for flavoring.
   - If desired, roll the Chom Chom in desiccated coconut or grated mawa while they are still warm. This adds texture and flavor to the dessert.

5. **Garnish and Serving:**
   - Garnish the Chom Chom with chopped pistachios or almonds for a decorative touch.
   - Serve the Chom Chom chilled or at room temperature, allowing the flavors to meld together.

Enjoy your homemade Kolkata-style Chom Chom!

## History

---

The history of Chom Chom is closely tied to the culinary traditions of Bengal, particularly in the region that encompasses present-day Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal. While the exact origin of Chom Chom is not definitively documented, it is believed to have emerged as a variation of another popular Bengali sweet called "Paneer Pitha."

Paneer Pitha, also known as "Pantua," is a traditional sweet made from paneer (Indian cottage cheese) dough that is deep-fried and soaked in sugar syrup. Chom Chom shares similarities with Paneer Pitha but differs in its cooking method and presentation.

The name "Chom Chom" is said to originate from the Bengali word "Chomchom," which refers to something that is soft and spongy, characteristics that aptly describe this sweet delicacy.

Over time, Chom Chom evolved into its own distinct dessert with its unique preparation method and flavor variations. It became a popular item in Bengali sweet shops and is often enjoyed during festivals, weddings, and other special occasions.

While its precise origin remains uncertain, Chom Chom's popularity has spread beyond Bengal and gained recognition as a beloved sweet treat across various parts of India and even in communities abroad where Bengali cuisine is celebrated.

Overall, Chom Chom represents not only a delightful dessert but also a reflection of the rich culinary heritage and cultural traditions of Bengal. Its journey from a regional delicacy to a globally recognized sweet underscores the enduring appeal and significance of traditional foods in shaping cultural identities.
