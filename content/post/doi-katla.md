The history of Doi Katla is closely intertwined with the culinary traditions of Bengal, a region known for its rich and diverse cuisine, particularly its love for fish-based dishes. While specific historical documentation regarding the origins of Doi Katla may be scarce, it is believed to have originated in Bengal, which has a long-standing tradition of using yogurt (doi) in cooking, especially in fish preparations.

Bengal, with its vast network of rivers, ponds, and water bodies, has been blessed with an abundance of freshwater fish, including Katla. Fish has always been an integral part of the Bengali diet and culture, and over the centuries, Bengali cuisine has evolved to include a wide array of fish dishes prepared using various cooking techniques and ingredients.

The use of yogurt in cooking, particularly in fish dishes, can be traced back to ancient times when yogurt was not only valued for its nutritional properties but also for its ability to tenderize meats and fish. This practice of marinating fish in yogurt, along with spices and herbs, likely evolved over generations as Bengali cooks experimented with different combinations of ingredients to create flavorful and aromatic dishes.

Doi Katla, with its tangy yogurt-based gravy and tender fish slices, has become a beloved dish in Bengal, enjoyed by people of all ages and backgrounds. While its exact origin story may be shrouded in the mists of time, its enduring popularity speaks to its delicious taste and cultural significance within the culinary landscape of Bengal.
