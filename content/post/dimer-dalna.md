## Introduction

---

"Dimer Dalna" is a traditional Bengali dish that features boiled eggs cooked in a flavorful gravy made of onions, tomatoes, and various spices. It is a popular dish in Bengali cuisine and is often served with rice or bread.

To prepare Dimer Dalna, boiled eggs are typically halved or pricked with a fork to allow the flavors of the gravy to penetrate. The gravy is made by sautéing onions, ginger, and garlic in oil until they turn golden brown. Then, spices such as turmeric, cumin, coriander, and chili powder are added to the mixture and cooked until fragrant.

Chopped tomatoes are added next, along with salt, sugar, and sometimes a splash of water to create a thick, rich gravy. The boiled eggs are then added to the gravy and simmered until they absorb the flavors of the sauce and become heated through.

Dimer Dalna is known for its aromatic spices and savory gravy, which pairs perfectly with steamed rice or chapatis. It is a comforting and satisfying dish that is enjoyed by many in Bengali households and is often prepared for special occasions or family gatherings.

## Instructions

---

1. Hard boil the eggs: Place the eggs in a saucepan and cover them with water. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and let the eggs simmer for about 10 minutes. Afterward, remove the eggs from the hot water and let them cool. Peel the eggs and set them aside.

2. Heat oil in a pan or kadhai over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the boiled eggs and fry them until they turn golden brown on all sides. Remove the eggs from the pan and set them aside.

3. In the same pan, add a little more oil if needed. Add the chopped onions and sauté until they turn translucent and golden brown.

4. Add ginger paste and garlic paste to the onions and cook for a couple of minutes until the raw smell disappears.

5. Add the chopped tomatoes and green chilies to the pan. Cook until the tomatoes become soft and mushy.

6. Add turmeric powder, cumin powder, coriander powder, red chili powder, sugar, and salt to the pan. Mix well and cook the spices for a minute or two until they release their aroma.

7. Add about 1/2 to 1 cup of water to the pan to make the gravy. Adjust the amount of water based on your desired consistency.

8. Carefully place the fried eggs into the gravy, ensuring they are submerged in the sauce. Cover the pan with a lid and let the eggs simmer in the gravy for about 5-7 minutes, allowing them to absorb the flavors.

9. Once the gravy reaches your desired consistency and the eggs are heated through, turn off the heat.

10. Garnish the Dimer Dalna with freshly chopped coriander leaves.

Serve hot with steamed rice, roti, or paratha. Enjoy your delicious Bengali-style Dimer Dalna!
