## Introduction

---

Chelo Kebab is a popular dish that originates from the culinary traditions of Kolkata, India. It's a delightful fusion of Persian and Indian flavors, reflecting the diverse cultural influences in the region.

The dish typically features succulent, flavorful kebabs made from finely minced meat, usually lamb or chicken, although variations with beef or mutton can also be found. The meat is marinated in a blend of spices which may include ginger, garlic, cumin, coriander, chili powder, and yogurt. These kebabs are then grilled or cooked on a skewer until tender and juicy.

The kebabs are served alongside Chelo rice, a Persian-inspired style of rice preparation. Chelo rice is typically long-grain and basmati rice that is parboiled and then steamed. It's known for its fluffy texture and subtle flavor. Sometimes, saffron is added to the rice for aroma and color.

Kolkata-style Chelo Kebab is a delicious and satisfying meal that showcases the harmonious blend of Persian and Indian culinary influences, offering a tantalizing experience for the taste buds.

## Ingredients

1. 500 grams of minced meat (lamb, chicken, beef, or mutton)
2. 2 tablespoons of ginger paste
3. 2 tablespoons of garlic paste
4. 1 teaspoon of cumin powder
5. 1 teaspoon of coriander powder
6. 1 teaspoon of chili powder (adjust according to taste)
7. 1/2 cup of plain yogurt
8. Salt to taste
9. Vegetable oil for grilling
10. 2 cups of long-grain basmati rice
11. A pinch of saffron threads (optional)
12. Fresh vegetables for salad (onions, tomatoes, cucumbers)
13. Lemon wedges for garnish
14. Fresh cilantro or mint leaves for garnish

## Instructions

1. **Marinate the Kebabs:**

   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the minced meat with ginger paste, garlic paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, chili powder, yogurt, and salt.
   - You can Mix well until all the spices are evenly distributed and the meat is thoroughly coated. Cover the bowl and let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld.

2. **Prepare the Chelo Rice:**

   - Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear to remove excess starch.
   - In a large pot, bring plenty of water to a boil. Add salt to the boiling water.
   - Add the rinsed rice to the boiling water and cook until it's parboiled, about 5-7 minutes. The rice should be partially cooked but still have a firm texture.
   - Drain the parboiled rice and rinse it under cold water to stop the cooking process and remove any excess starch.
   - In a separate small bowl, soak the saffron threads in a few tablespoons of warm water for about 10 minutes.
   - In a large pot or rice cooker, add a tablespoon of oil. Layer the parboiled rice evenly in the pot. Drizzle the saffron water over the rice, creating a marbled effect if desired.
   - Cover the pot and cook the rice on low heat for about 10-15 minutes until it's fully cooked and fluffy. Keep it warm until ready to serve.

3. **Grill the Kebabs:**

   - Preheat your grill or barbecue to medium-high heat.
   - Thread the marinated meat onto skewers, shaping them into kebabs.
   - Brush the grill grates with oil to prevent sticking.
   - Place the kebabs on the grill and cook for about 8-10 minutes, turning occasionally, until they are cooked through and charred on the outside.
   - Once cooked, remove the kebabs from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes.

4. **Prepare the Salad and Accompaniments:**

   - Slice the onions, tomatoes, and cucumbers thinly. Arrange them on a serving platter.
   - Garnish the salad with freshly chopped cilantro or mint leaves.
   - Serve lemon wedges on the side for garnish.

5. **Serve:**

   - Arrange the grilled kebabs on a large platter alongside the Chelo rice and fresh salad.
   - Garnish the kebabs with additional cilantro or mint leaves.
   - Serve hot with lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over the kebabs.

Enjoy your delicious Kolkata-style Chelo Kebab!
