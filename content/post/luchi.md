## Ingredients

**Ingredients:**

1. 2 cups of refined wheat flour (maida)
2. Water, as needed
3. 1 tablespoon of oil or ghee (optional)
4. Salt, to taste
5. Oil or ghee for deep frying

## Instructions

---

1. **Prepare the Dough:**

   - In a large mixing bowl, add the refined wheat flour (maida).
   - If using, add a tablespoon of oil or ghee to the flour for added richness and flavor.
   - Add salt to taste.
   - Gradually add water while kneading the flour to form a soft and pliable dough. The dough should be smooth and elastic.
   - Once the dough is well-kneaded, cover it with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let it rest for about 15-20 minutes. This resting period helps the gluten to relax, making the dough easier to work with and resulting in softer luchis.

2. **Divide and Roll the Dough:**

   - After resting, divide the dough into small, lemon-sized balls.
   - Take one ball of dough and roll it between your palms to make it smooth.
   - Flatten the ball slightly and dust it with a little flour to prevent sticking.
   - Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough ball into a thin, round disc. Aim for a thickness of about 1-2 mm.

3. **Heat the Oil:**

   - In a deep frying pan or kadai, heat oil or ghee over medium-high heat. The oil should be hot but not smoking.

4. **Fry the Luchis:**

   - Once the oil is hot, carefully slide one rolled-out dough disc into the oil.
   - Press the luchi gently with a slotted spoon to help it puff up.
   - Fry the luchi until it puffs up and turns golden brown on both sides, flipping it occasionally. This should take about 1-2 minutes per side.
   - Once done, use a slotted spoon to remove the luchi from the oil and transfer it to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.
   - Repeat the process with the remaining dough balls, frying them one at a time.

5. **Serve:**
   - Serve the hot and crispy luchis immediately with your choice of side dish, such as potato curry (aloor tarkari), chickpea curry (chole), lentil curry (dal), or any other accompaniment of your choice.
   - Enjoy your delicious homemade luchis!

Note: Be cautious while frying the luchis to ensure they cook evenly and don't burn. Adjust the heat as needed to maintain the temperature of the oil. Additionally, you can cover the rolled-out dough discs with a clean kitchen towel to prevent them from drying out while you roll out the rest of the dough.
