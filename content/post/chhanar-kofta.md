## Introduction

---

Chhanar kofta is a popular Indian vegetarian dish that originates from the state of West Bengal, known for its rich culinary heritage. It is a delicacy commonly prepared during festivals, special occasions, and celebrations.

The dish primarily consists of soft, spongy dumplings made from chhana (a type of fresh cheese similar to paneer) mixed with various spices, herbs, and sometimes stuffed with nuts. These dumplings are typically deep-fried until golden brown, giving them a crispy exterior while maintaining a soft, creamy interior.

Chhanar kofta is typically served hot with Indian flatbreads like naan or roti, or alongside fragrant basmati rice. It is a beloved dish among vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike, appreciated for its satisfying taste and comforting qualities.

## Instructions

---

1. **Prepare the Chhana (Paneer):**

   - Heat the milk in a heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat until it comes to a boil.
   - Reduce the heat and add lemon juice or vinegar gradually while stirring continuously until the milk curdles completely.
   - Once the whey separates from the curdled milk and the curds look grainy, turn off the heat.
   - Strain the mixture through a muslin cloth or a fine sieve to separate the chhana (paneer) from the whey.
   - Rinse the chhana under cold water to remove any traces of lemon juice or vinegar. Squeeze out excess water and hang the chhana in the cloth for about 30 minutes to drain excess moisture.

2. **Prepare the Koftas:**

   - In a mixing bowl, crumble the prepared chhana and add all-purpose flour, cornflour, ginger paste, green chili paste, salt, and sugar.
   - Mix well to form a smooth dough-like consistency. If the mixture is too dry, add a little milk to bind it together.
   - Divide the mixture into small portions and shape them into smooth, round balls or oval-shaped dumplings.
   - Heat oil for deep frying in a pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully add the koftas in batches and fry until they turn golden brown and crispy from all sides.
   - Remove the fried koftas using a slotted spoon and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.

3. **Prepare the Gravy:**

   - Heat oil or ghee in a separate pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.
   - Add chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown and translucent.
   - Stir in ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another minute until the raw aroma disappears.
   - Add tomato puree and cook until the oil starts to separate from the masala.
   - Add coriander powder, cumin powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala powder, and salt. Mix well and cook for a couple of minutes.
   - Pour in water and bring the gravy to a gentle simmer. Cook for 5-7 minutes until the gravy thickens slightly.
   - Optionally, add fresh cream to the gravy and stir well to combine.

4. **Assemble the Dish:**
   - Just before serving, gently place the fried koftas in the simmering gravy.
   - Allow the koftas to simmer in the gravy for 3-4 minutes to absorb the flavors.
   - Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves and a drizzle of fresh cream if desired.
   - Serve hot with naan, roti, or steamed rice.

## History

---

The history of Chhanar Kofta traces back to the rich culinary traditions of Bengal, particularly in the region of West Bengal, India. Bengal has a diverse and vibrant food culture, influenced by its geography, climate, and the intermingling of various ethnic and cultural communities over centuries.

The origins of Chhanar Kofta can be linked to the widespread popularity of paneer (also known as chhana in Bengali), a fresh cheese made by curdling milk and separating the curds from the whey. Paneer has been a staple ingredient in Indian cuisine for centuries, with references to it found in ancient Indian texts such as the Vedas.

In Bengal, where dairy farming has historically been significant, paneer holds a special place in the culinary repertoire. The innovative use of paneer led to the creation of various dishes, including Chhanar Kofta, which showcases the versatility of this dairy product.

While the exact historical origins of Chhanar Kofta are not documented, it is believed to have evolved over time as a vegetarian alternative to meat-based kofta dishes. Koftas, which are typically meatballs or dumplings, are common across many cuisines in the Indian subcontinent, including Mughlai and Awadhi cuisines, where they are often made with minced meat and aromatic spices.

In Bengal, where a significant portion of the population follows a vegetarian diet, Chhanar Kofta emerged as a flavorful and indulgent dish suitable for special occasions and festivities. The combination of soft, creamy paneer dumplings with a rich, spiced gravy reflects the culinary ingenuity of Bengali cuisine.

Over the years, Chhanar Kofta has become a beloved and iconic dish in Bengali cuisine, enjoyed by people of all backgrounds. It continues to be prepared in homes, restaurants, and during festive occasions, showcasing the enduring appeal of traditional Bengali flavors and culinary techniques.
