1. **Prepare the Crab**:

   - Clean the crabs thoroughly under running water.
   - Remove the top shell, apron, and gills. Cut the crabs into pieces.

2. **Heat Oil**:

   - Heat mustard oil in a heavy-bottomed pan or kadhai over medium heat.

3. **Temper Spices**:

   - Add cumin seeds, mustard seeds, bay leaves, whole dry red chilies, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, and cloves to the hot oil.
   - Sauté until the spices start to splutter and become fragrant.

4. **Add Aromatics**:

   - Add chopped onions, minced garlic, grated ginger, and slit green chilies to the pan.

5. **Add Tomatoes and Spices**:

   - Add turmeric powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, red chili powder, and salt to taste. Mix well.
