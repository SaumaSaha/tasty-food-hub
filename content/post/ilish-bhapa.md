## Ingredients

---

1. 4 pieces of Hilsa fish (Ilish)
2. 4 tablespoons mustard paste
3. 4 tablespoons grated coconut
4. 2-3 green chilies, finely chopped
5. 2 tablespoons mustard oil
6. 4 tablespoons yogurt
7. 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
8. Salt to taste
9. 1 teaspoon sugar (optional)
10. Banana leaves or aluminum foil for wrapping

## Instructions

1. **Clean the Fish:**
   Rinse the Hilsa fish pieces thoroughly under cold water. Pat them dry with a paper towel. You can keep the fish whole or cut them into pieces as per your preference.

2. **Prepare the Marinade:**
   In a bowl, combine mustard paste, grated coconut, chopped green chilies, mustard oil, yogurt, turmeric powder, salt, and sugar (if using). Mix well to form a smooth marinade.

3. **Marinate the Fish:**
   Coat each fish piece generously with the marinade mixture. Ensure that the fish is evenly coated on all sides. You can also make a few slits on the fish pieces to help the marinade penetrate better.

4. **Wrap in Banana Leaves or Foil:**
   Take banana leaves or aluminum foil and cut them into squares large enough to wrap each fish piece individually. Place a fish piece in the center of each square and wrap it tightly, securing the edges.

5. **Steam the Fish:**
   Heat water in a steamer. Once the water comes to a gentle boil, place the wrapped fish parcels in the steamer basket. Cover and steam for about 15-20 minutes on medium heat, or until the fish is cooked through and tender.

6. **Check for Doneness:**
   After 15-20 minutes, carefully unwrap one parcel to check if the fish is cooked. The flesh should be opaque and easily flake with a fork. If it's not fully cooked, rewrap and steam for a few more minutes.

7. **Serve:**
   Once done, carefully remove the fish parcels from the steamer. Serve hot with steamed rice. You can garnish with extra mustard oil or chopped coriander leaves for added flavor.

8. **Enjoy:**
   Ilish Bhapa is best enjoyed hot, allowing the flavors of mustard, coconut, and spices to tantalize your taste buds.

This recipe yields tender and flavorful Hilsa fish infused with the aromatic blend of mustard, coconut, and spices, making it a quintessential Bengali delicacy.
