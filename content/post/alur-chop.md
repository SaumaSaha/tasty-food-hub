## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Potatoes:**

   - Wash and scrub the potatoes thoroughly.
   - Boil the potatoes until they are completely cooked. You can boil them in a pot of water or pressure cook them.
   - Once boiled, peel the potatoes and mash them in a mixing bowl until smooth. Set aside.

2. **Prepare the Filling:**

   - Heat a tablespoon of oil in a pan over medium heat.
   - Add chopped onions and sauté until they turn translucent.
   - Add minced garlic, grated ginger, and chopped green chilies. Sauté for another 2-3 minutes until the raw smell disappears.
   - Now, add the mashed potatoes to the pan along with turmeric powder, cumin powder, coriander powder, garam masala powder, chopped cilantro, and salt. Mix well until all the ingredients are combined and cook for 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat and let the mixture cool down.

3. **Shape the Alur Chop:**

   - Once the potato mixture has cooled down, take a small portion of the mixture and shape it into a smooth ball. Then, flatten it slightly to form a patty. Repeat this process with the remaining mixture.
   - If desired, you can stuff the patties with a small amount of filling like green peas or paneer.

4. **Prepare the Batter:**

   - In a bowl, mix gram flour (besan) with water to make a smooth batter. The consistency should be thick enough to coat the potato patties evenly. Season the batter with a pinch of salt and turmeric powder for color.

5. **Coat and Fry the Alur Chop:**

   - Heat oil in a deep frying pan or kadhai over medium heat.
   - Dip each potato patty into the prepared gram flour batter, ensuring it is evenly coated.
   - If desired, you can roll the coated patties in breadcrumbs for an extra crispy texture.
   - Carefully place the coated patties into the hot oil and fry until they turn golden brown and crispy on all sides. Make sure to fry them in batches, so as not to overcrowd the pan.
   - Once fried, remove the alur chops from the oil using a slotted spoon and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.

6. **Serve:**
   - Serve the hot and crispy alur chops immediately with your favorite chutney or sauce, such as tamarind chutney or mint chutney. Enjoy!

This detailed preparation will give you delicious and crispy alur chops that are perfect as a snack or appetizer for any occasion.
