To replicate Bhetki Macher Paturi at home, you might want to consider the following steps:

1. **Marination:**

   - Clean the Bhetki fish fillets thoroughly and pat them dry with a paper towel.
   - In a mixing bowl, combine mustard paste, poppy seed paste, coconut paste, chopped green chilies, turmeric powder, and salt.
   - Add mustard oil to the mixture and blend everything well to form a smooth, thick marinade.

2. **Coating the Fish:**

   - Coat each fish fillet generously with the prepared marinade. Make sure to cover the fillets on all sides, ensuring they are well-coated with the flavorful mixture.
   - Allow the fish to marinate for at least 30 minutes. This allows the flavors to penetrate the fish.

   - Cut banana leaves into square or rectangular pieces, large enough to wrap each fish fillet.
   - Lightly heat the banana leaves over an open flame or in a pan to make them pliable and easy to work with.

5. **Serving:**

   - Once cooked, carefully open the banana leaf parcels.
   - Serve the Bhetki Macher Paturi hot with steamed rice. The banana leaves impart a distinct aroma to the dish.
