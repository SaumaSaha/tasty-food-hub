## Ingredients

---

1. 1 cup yellow split mung beans (moong dal)
2. Oil for frying
3. 1 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)

## Instructions

1. **Preparation**:
   Begin by thoroughly rinsing the moong dal under running water to remove any dirt or debris. Then, spread it out on a clean kitchen towel or paper towel to dry completely. Ensure there's no moisture left on the dal.

2. **Heating the Oil**:
   Heat oil in a deep frying pan or kadai over medium heat. You'll need enough oil to submerge the dal for frying. As the oil heats up, you can test if it's ready by dropping a small piece of dal into the oil â€“ if it sizzles and rises to the surface, the oil is hot enough for frying.

3. **Frying the Dal**:
   Carefully add the dried moong dal to the hot oil. Fry the dal in batches if necessary to prevent overcrowding the pan, which can result in uneven frying. Stir the dal occasionally to ensure even cooking and to prevent sticking.

4. **Fry Until Golden Brown**:
   It will take approximately 5-7 minutes for the dal to turn golden brown and become crispy. Keep a close eye on the dal as it can quickly go from golden brown to burnt. Adjust the heat as needed to maintain a consistent temperature.

5. **Drain and Season**:
   Once the dal is golden brown and crispy, use a slotted spoon to transfer it from the oil to a plate lined with paper towels. This helps to absorb any excess oil. Sprinkle salt evenly over the fried dal while it's still hot. If you're using any optional spices, you can add them at this stage as well. Toss the dal gently to ensure the salt and spices are evenly distributed.

6. **Cooling and Storing**:
   Allow the Bhaja Moong Dal to cool completely before transferring it to an airtight container for storage. It can be stored at room temperature for several days.

7. **Serving**:
   Bhaja Moong Dal is typically served as a crunchy snack or accompaniment to rice and curry dishes. Enjoy it hot or at room temperature.

**Tips:**

- Ensure the moong dal is completely dry before frying to prevent splattering when it comes into contact with hot oil.
- Use a deep-frying pan or kadai with enough oil to submerge the dal fully for even frying.
- Keep an eye on the dal while frying to prevent it from burning.
- Adjust the seasoning according to your taste preferences.
- Experiment with different spices to create variations in flavor.

Following these steps should result in crispy, flavorful Bhaja Moong Dal that you can enjoy as a snack or side dish with your favorite meals.
