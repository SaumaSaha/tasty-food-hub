## Introduction

---

Mutton Kosha, also known as Kosha Mangsho, is a popular and flavorful Bengali dish originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is a slow-cooked mutton curry with a rich and spicy gravy. The term "kosha" refers to the slow-cooking process that allows the meat to absorb the flavors of the spices and develop a deep, robust taste. Mutton Kosha is often served with steamed rice or Indian bread like paratha or naan. The slow-cooking process ensures that the meat becomes succulent and the spices blend to create a dish that is both aromatic and flavorful.

## Ingredients

1. Mutton (goat meat): Usually bone-in pieces are used for better flavor.
2. Onions: Sliced and caramelized to add sweetness to the gravy.
3. Tomatoes: Chopped or pureed to provide a tangy flavor.
4. Ginger-Garlic Paste: For the base flavor.
5. Green Chilies: To add heat.
6. Yogurt: Adds creaminess and helps tenderize the meat.
7. Spices: Commonly used spices include cumin, coriander, turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, and bay leaves.
8. Mustard Oil: Traditionally used for cooking in Bengali cuisine, adding a distinctive flavor

## Instructions

1. Marinate the mutton pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, and salt. Allow it to marinate for at least a few hours or overnight for better flavor absorption.
2. Heat mustard oil in a heavy-bottomed pan. The use of mustard oil contributes to the authentic taste of the dish.
3. Add sliced onions and saut√© until golden brown, giving a sweet base to the curry.
4. Add the marinated mutton and cook until the meat is seared and browned.
5. Incorporate chopped tomatoes, green chilies, and the remaining spices. Cook until the oil starts to separate from the masala, indicating that it's well-cooked.
6. Slow-cook the mutton, allowing it to absorb the flavors. This step is crucial for the kosha preparation, and it may take some time until the meat is tender and the gravy reaches the desired consistency.
7. Adjust seasoning and garnish with fresh coriander leaves before serving.
