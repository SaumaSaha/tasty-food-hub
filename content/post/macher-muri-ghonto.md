## Instructions

1. **Marinate the Fish Heads**:
   Rub the fish heads with 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder and a little salt. Let them marinate for about 15-20 minutes.

2. **Prepare the Rice**:
   Rinse the Basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for about 15-20 minutes. Then, drain and set aside.

3. **Fry the Fish Heads**:
   Heat 3 tablespoons of mustard oil in a deep-bottomed pan or kadhai over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the fish heads and fry them until golden brown on both sides. Remove the fish heads from the pan and set them aside.

4. **Prepare the Gravy**:
   In the same pan, add the remaining mustard oil. Add bay leaves and chopped onions. Sauté until the onions turn golden brown.

5. **Add Aromatics**:
   Add ginger-garlic paste and slit green chilies to the pan. Sauté for a couple of minutes until the raw smell disappears.

6. **Add Spices**:
   Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, cumin powder, coriander powder, and salt to the pan. Mix well and cook the spices for a minute or two.

7. **Cook Potatoes and Tomatoes**:
   Add diced potatoes and chopped tomatoes to the pan. Cook until the tomatoes turn soft and the potatoes are slightly tender.

8. **Add Rice**:
   Add the soaked and drained Basmati rice to the pan. Mix well with the spices and vegetables. Let the rice fry for a couple of minutes.

9. **Add Water**:
   Pour enough water into the pan to cover the rice and vegetables. The water level should be about half an inch above the rice. Stir gently.

10. **Cook the Dish**:
    Cover the pan and let the rice cook over medium heat until it's almost done, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking to the bottom.

11. **Add Fried Fish Heads**:
    Once the rice is almost cooked, carefully place the fried fish heads on top of the rice in a single layer. Sprinkle garam masala powder over the fish heads.

12. **Finish Cooking**:
    Cover the pan again and let the fish heads cook along with the rice for another 5-10 minutes or until the rice is fully cooked and the fish heads are tender.

13. **Garnish and Serve**:
    Once done, remove from heat and let it sit for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves before serving hot.
