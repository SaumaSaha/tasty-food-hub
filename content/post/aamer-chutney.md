## Ingredients

---

1. 2 large raw green mangoes, peeled and chopped
2. 1 cup sugar (adjust according to taste and tartness of mangoes)
3. 2-3 tablespoons mustard oil
4. 1 teaspoon panch phoron (a mix of fenugreek seeds, nigella seeds, cumin seeds, black mustard seeds, and fennel seeds)
5. 1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
6. Salt to taste

## Instructions

---

. **Prepare the Mangoes:**

- Peel the raw mangoes using a peeler or knife.
- Cut them into small, uniform pieces. Discard the seeds.

2. **Heat Mustard Oil:**

   - In a heavy-bottomed pan or kadhai, heat the mustard oil over medium heat.
   - Mustard oil has a strong flavor, so ensure it's heated well but not smoking.

3. **Add Panch Phoron:**

   - Once the oil is hot, add the panch phoron mix.
   - Allow the seeds to crackle and release their aroma, which will take about 30 seconds to a minute.

4. **Add Mangoes:**

   - Carefully add the chopped mangoes to the pan.
   - Stir well to coat the mango pieces with the oil and spices.

5. **Cook the Mangoes:**

   - Cook the mangoes over medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
   - This helps the mangoes to soften slightly and absorb the flavors.

6. **Add Sugar:**

   - After the mangoes have softened a bit, add the sugar to the pan.
   - Stir well to combine the sugar with the mangoes.
   - Adjust the amount of sugar according to your taste preference and the tartness of the mangoes.

7. **Seasoning:**

   - Sprinkle red chili powder over the mangoes for a hint of heat.
   - Add salt to taste.

8. **Simmer:**

   - Lower the heat to medium-low and let the chutney simmer.
   - Stir occasionally to prevent sticking and ensure even cooking.

9. **Thicken:**

   - Allow the chutney to simmer until the mangoes are completely softened and the mixture has thickened.
   - This may take around 15-20 minutes depending on the consistency you prefer.

10. **Cool and Store:**
    - Once the chutney reaches your desired consistency, remove it from the heat.
    - Let it cool to room temperature before transferring it to clean, sterilized jars.
    - Store the aamer chutney in the refrigerator for longer shelf life.

**Serving Suggestions:**

- Enjoy Bengali-style aamer chutney as a condiment with rice, roti, paratha, or any Indian bread.
- It also complements snacks like samosas, pakoras, or even as a spread in sandwiches.
- Use it as a side dish for your meals to add a burst of tangy flavor.

With these detailed steps, you can create a delicious batch of Bengali-style aamer chutney to elevate your meals. Adjust the sweetness and spiciness according to your taste preferences for a perfect balance of flavors.
